## **Conclusion**

In summary, I observed a clear pattern in the current successful campaigns in Kickstarters and summarized several key elements which leads to a successful campaign. 

For Kickstarter, they should value those key elements and tried to build a prediction model to decide which project they should promote. Kickstarter’s goal should be to have as many successfully-funded campaigns as possible. This is especially important because if a campaign doesn’t reach its funding goal, it receives none of the money and the project is very likely to cease to exist.

## **Implication**

Through this analysis, Kickstarter can now do the following:

 + Understand their target market and usage trends to make general marketing more effective - i.e. concentrating marketing dollars around the work schedule

 + Create generalized “tips and tricks” as marketing assets based on insights around what campaign attributes tend to lead to more successful campaigns
 
 + Be proactive about marketing to high-failure-risk campaigns including featuring high potential campaigns, as “staff picks” to increase success rate
