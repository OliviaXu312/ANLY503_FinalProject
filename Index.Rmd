## **Project Background**

[Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) is an online crowdfunding platform aimed at helping people get their ideas funded while building a community of fans to support their ideas. While Kickstarter publishes many advice and best-practices articles on their blog, over half of campaigns still fail.

*Why does this matter?*  

Unlike their competitor, Indiegogo, Kickstarter campaign projects follow an "all or nothing" funding model. This means that if a Kickstarter campaign fails, both the project creators are disappointed, as well as the people who did contribute because the project will not be completed in any capacity.

## **Project Objectives**

**Understand the marketplace**: Exploring the current Kickstarter markeplace, answering questions including which type of campaigns are the mainstream of the market, how to name a project and how to write description of campaigns and more.

**Provide insight**: By diving into the current attributes to figure out which attributes are more likely to make campaigns successful.

**Identify a business opportunity**: Identify a business opportunity for Kickstarter by finding campaigns just below the
predicted threshold of success and helping them get to their goal, helping both parties earn revenue.


## **Data**

**Kickstarter data**: The dataset was web-scraped from kickstarter website through a scraper robot provided by webrobots website. From which I selected the most recent data on over 70, 000 Kickstarter campaigns as of November 12 2020.
